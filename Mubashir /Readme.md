**City Distance Tracker**
This project aims to create a basic distance tracker between cities, facilitating users to manage city-to-city distances and find optimal routes. Key features include adding cities and their corresponding distances, viewing direct distances between cities, manually finding the shortest path using basic logic, and displaying all possible routes.
**Features:**
Add Cities and Distances: Allows users to input cities and their distances from each other.
View City-to-City Distance: Provides the distance between any two cities.
Find Shortest Path: Manually computes the shortest path between two cities.
Display All Routes: Shows all possible routes between cities.
**Data Structures and Algorithms Concepts:**
2D Arrays / Matrix: Used to store and manage distances between cities.
Graph Basics (Optional): Cities represented as nodes for potential graph-based algorithms.
Searching: Implements city lookup functionality
Structures: Utilizes structured data for managing city information.
