<h1>Terminal-Based Weather Forecast System</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  This project is a command-line based application designed to provide real-time or simulated weather information for various cities or regions. 
  The system enables users to search weather data by city name, view key weather parameters, and sort cities based on temperature or other weather conditions.
</p>

<p>
  It utilizes fundamental <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</strong> such as <strong>hashing</strong>, <strong>searching</strong>, and <strong>sorting</strong> 
  to ensure efficient data handling and performance. The goal is to demonstrate how core programming concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems 
  in a text-based environment.
</p>

<h2>Key Functionalities</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Search:</strong> Look up weather by entering a city name.</li>
  <li><strong>Display:</strong> Show temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the selected city.</li>
  <li><strong>Sort:</strong> Rank cities by temperature or other weather metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> C++, Python (or similar)</li>
  <li><strong>Interface:</strong> Terminal / Command Line</li>
  <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Hash Tables, Sorting Algorithms, Search Functions</li>
</ul>
