## 🚀 Features

- 📂 **Input a text file**
- 📊 **Analyze character frequency**
- 📦 **Compress using Huffman encoding**
- 📉 **Displays original, compressed sizes, and space saved**

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Frequency Map / Hash Map
- Min Heap (Priority Queue)
- Binary Tree Construction
- Recursion for Tree Traversal
- File I/O Handling (Read/Write)
- String & Pointer Manipulation
