Title:
Student Marks Analyzer

Project Summary:
The Student Marks Analyzer is a C++-based console application designed to manage, sort, and analyze student academic data in a dynamic and efficient manner. This project uses a singly linked list as the primary data structure to store student records, and applies the merge sort algorithm to sort students by marks in descending order, thus determining their academic ranks.

The system allows users to:
Dynamically add student records (name and marks)

Sort the records based on marks using merge sort

Display the sorted list along with student ranks

Search for a specific student by name and view their corresponding rank and marks

This project integrates important Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA) concepts such as:

Linked Lists for dynamic storage and memory efficiency

Merge Sort for optimized sorting

Linear Search for rank lookup

Pointers for managing nodes and list traversal

By combining these techniques, the application simulates a basic rank management system suitable for schools, colleges, and academic data analysis tasks.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: C++

Core Concepts: Linked Lists, Merge Sort, Recursion, Pointers,Searching technique.

Use Cases:
Academic institutions managing dynamic student records

Automated result processing and rank generation

Practical demonstration of DSA in real-world systems

Outcome:
The project showcases the practical utility of core data structures and algorithms while providing a clear and functional tool for analyzing and organizing student marks data. It serves as an educational and functional solution that can be further enhanced with file storage, GUI, or database integration.
