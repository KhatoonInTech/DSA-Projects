This terminal-based shopping cart system allows users to manage their shopping cart using a linked list structure. Each item in the cart is represented by a node,
which stores the product's name, quantity, and price. The system supports adding and removing items, viewing the cart, and calculating the total price. Users can 
also sort items in the cart either by name or price using sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort. This project leverages pointers and dynamic memory 
management through linked lists for efficient handling of cart data.
