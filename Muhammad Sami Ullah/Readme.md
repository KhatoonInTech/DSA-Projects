Project: 'Unit Converter'
By : Muhammad Sami Ullah
Summary:
This project is a menu-driven, modular unit converter application written in C++. It allows users to convert between various units across four major categories: Length, Weight, Temperature, and Time. The interface supports multiple conversions in one session and logs each conversion to a file for future reference.
